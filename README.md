# python_workbooks
This is a very very simple starting point for adding exercises. It's only here to hold a shell for ideas. 

when you first run it in code spaces, the intent is to run the command `python` in the terminal to start python, then copy paste your written code in the new shell.

near term improvements: 
1. add the rest of Rosario's prompts
2. add other prompts
3. add connector to bigquery so students can practice the bigquery cli

4.
