# Python Workbooks for Self-Assessing Understanding of Python Basics and Pandas

## Overview
This repository contains exercises designed to help participants practice the basics of Python and Pandas. The exercises cover various data manipulation and analysis tasks, including importing data, inspecting data structures, filtering data, and more.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository and open it in GitHub Codespaces. When you first run it in Codespaces, the intent is to run the command `python` in the terminal to start a Python interactive shell, then copy and paste your written code into the shell.

### Exercise File
The exercises are provided in the `bythonworkbook.py` file. Follow the instructions and complete each exercise step-by-step.

### Solutions File
If you need help or want to check your work, you can refer to the `python_wb_with_code.py` file, which contains the solutions to the exercises.

### Exercises
0. Import necessary libraries and load data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
1. Inspect the DataFrame to understand its structure and content.
2. Filter data based on specific conditions.
3. Select specific columns and rename them.
4. Identify and handle missing data in the DataFrame.
5. Translate a SQL query into Pandas code.
6. Perform grouping and aggregation operations.

## Near Term Improvements
1. Add the rest of Rosario's prompts - this is done
2. Add other prompts.
3. Add connector to BigQuery so students can practice the BigQuery CLI.
